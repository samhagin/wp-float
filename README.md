== Description ==

WP Float enables you to add a float/fixed item to Wordpress. This can be used for Advertisements, Images, Text or any HTML. 
You can choose to show the float/fixed item on the homepage only, posts only or pages only. You can also run as many 
instances of WP Float and also include shortcode support for posts and pages. Float items follow the cursor as the 
user scrolls up and down while fixed items stay at the same position.
